# Projects

This document has a list of potential projects for Live Hardware Development.
The document has a high level description and dependence chain for several
potential master thesis/project ideas. Contact Jose Renau if you want to work
on any of them to provide more details.

If you are an UCSC student, contact Professor Jose Renau
(https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~renau/) to coordinate, the idea is that you can do
a MS thesis/project or an undergraduate senior design project. It should take 2
full quarters. If there is enough progress and funds are available, it may be
possible to provide 1 quarter GSR in the last quarter for master students.

At the end of the document there is a list of finished projects as example, and
small tasks that are not enough for a thesis/project, but great to help.


# Open Projects

Open projects are potential MS thesis/projects.


## Verilog input with a slang 2 LNAST pass

slang (https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang) is an open source System Verilog parser/compiler.
It is fairly fast and complete. The goal of this project is to interface slang to LNAST. Notice
that this is just from slang to LNAST, not from LNAST to slang.

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Focus on synthesizable verilog. It has to support packages, structs, and interfaces but not need
to handle classes.
* Key benchmarks to handle are (in order):
    * CHISEL generated verilog. Mostly firesim (https://fires.im/) generated for rocket and BOOM
    * Titan23 (http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~kmurray/titan.html).
    * Anubis (https://github.com/masc-ucsc/anubis)
* Regression set
    * slang->lnast->lgraph->lnast->cgen (C++ and verilog+lgcheck)
        * https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v/tree/master/test
    * slang->lnast->lgraph->lnast->cgen (verilog+lgcheck)
        * BOOM
        * https://github.com/SymbiFlow/sv-tests
        * https://github.com/taichi-ishitani/tnoc
* The interface with slang could be through the C++ ASTVisitor in slang or maybe just handling the dumped json

## Lgraph to Yosys JSON

The json format from yosys is used by several tools like nextpnr and netlistsvg. Creating the json interface
could simplify the interface with yosys too.

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Create a yosysjson pass that generates yosys compatible json files out of Lgraph
* It may be also interesting to accept yosys json as input. Then, the bridge between yosys and LiveHD could be removed.

## Hot-Reload Simulation Console

Bring to the LNAST C++ code generation the capacity to perform Hot-Reload. Some of these concepts
were implemented in Heaven Skinner PhD thesis hot reload chapter.

Dependence: This project can not be started until the C++ from LNAST is not finished

Main features:

* Client/server
    * Client is the console
    * Server is running the simulation. Create a unique URL id for each run
    * A console can attach to different servers if URL is known (server.connect(url) command)
* Checkpointing
    * Run simulation and capacity to checkpoint contents
    * create simulation checkpoints (push/pop command)
* Waveform
    * Capacity to dump test waveforms on screen (wave.save command)
    * Live binary format with mmaps that allow the simulation to run and the console to monitor the values
    * Capacity to generate LXT2 (gtkwave). (wave.lxt2 command)
* Console
    * Use replxx for the console (same as lgshell)
    * A gdb-like deamon (remote zero-MQ?) and console to debug hardware
    * The console is a chaiscript language with extensions for the auto-complete
    * autocomplete in variables/wires
    * Show paths. From X to Y. Some similarity: https://www.jameswhanlon.com/querying-logical-paths-in-a-verilog-design.html
    * Allow to peek/poke variables
    * Allow to hot-reload pyrope generated assertions to stop simulation
    * Allow to create markers for passing failing code to other people
    * Aloow to have command script file (load checkpoint, run X, mark Y, insert assert Y, continue x, peek X, poke Y, save waveform)

## Tree-sitter Pyrope

Build a tree-sitter Pyrope grammar that can spill CFG like the pegjs.

* Pyrope tree-sitter grammar
* CFG dump that LNAST understands
* Atom integration
* Atom go definition, highlight, and attribute
* Atom capacity to query LNAST/LGraph generated grammar for bit-width. The incremental grammar passed to LNAST, passed to LGraph,
  and incremental bit-width inference.

## LGraph partition/decomposition/coloring

Implement several partitioning/coloring algorithms in LGraph. The
attributes/colors could be used for synthesis/placement/...

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Implement some fast decomposition algorithms:
* "Bottom-Up Disjoint-Support Decomposition Based on Cofactor and Boolean Difference Analysis" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7357181/
* "Bi-decomposition of large Boolean functions using blocking edge graphs" https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2133553
* Break graph partitions in disjoin sets and areas that do not have cross optimization (disjoin)
* Mark graph with hypergraph partition
* Patch traversal so that we have fast/forward/backward for a "color graph"

## Parallel and Hierarchical Synthesis with Mockturtle

Mockturtle is integrated with LiveHD. The goal of this task is to iron out bugs
and issues and to use the LiveHD Tasks API to parallelize the synthesis.

Dependence: none

Main features:

* The current synthesis divides the circuit in partitions. Each partition can be synthesized in parallel.
* Support hierarchical synthesis to optimize cross Lgraphs (cross verilog module optimization)

## Bring Back Incremental Synthesis to LGraph

WARNING: Traversal/color depdendence

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Reimplement the DAC synthesis in LGraph
* Re-run anubis to get data

## OpenWare

We need a set of set of implementations with different trade-offs for each basic LGraph gate. The implementations
could optimize for FPGA and ASIC.

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Custom implementations for all the LGraph cells: reductions, add/sub, mult, shift, barrel shifter...
* The OpenWare library is built in Pyrope, with efficient verilog generated
* Benchmark the OpenWare against FPGA and ASIC default (designWare) targets
* Specific target implementations for FPGA (Xilinx) and ASIC (generic)
* Several speeds/trade-offs for each major block. E.g: adder RCA/Kogge/...

## Synthesis (ASIC/FPGA) Competitive Analysis

Competitive analysis finding main weakpoints for the synthesis flow. Both FPGA and ASIC targets.

Dependence: Mockturtle + OpenWare projects

Main features:

* Goal to run several large tests (Anubis) and BOOM and Titan23 (http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~kmurray/titan.html).
* Compare against vivado, quartus, DC, ABC, Mockturtle.... results can not be published directly but OK as A/B/C vs LGraph+XX.
* Important to focus on OpenWare LGraph flow vs others
* Create regression system that plots freq/area/power for several key benchmarks

## Useful LGraph Passes

LGraph has several passes. Many compiler like passes that can be used by
several projects. This is a set of those unrelated passes.

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Find combinational loops and notified LoC responsible
* Find cross clock domain and check that it has acceptable patters to cross. Allow to be extensible
* Copy propagation and Dead-code elimination in LGRAPH with and without hierarchy
* Check LGraph consistency. E.g: NOT should have same bits input/output edges

## Dynamic Power Model

Performance is important, but dynamic power consumption it is too. The goal is to generate power consumption results.

Dependence: Hot Reload

Main features:

* Estimate power statically and dynamically
    * Statically: Use activity rates (could be imported from previous run)
    * Dynamically: generate power consumption trace
    * Dynamic power should be a switch from simulation. Not a VCD/LXT2 dump process. This will allow feedback on simulation.
    * Clock gating efficiency/static can be off-line
* Estimate clock gating efficiency, recommend clock gating points after dynamic run
* Read liberty for power and have some approximate model for interconnect. The idea is good average out, not exact per cell.

## Liberty

Liberty is de-factor industry standards. The goal is to parse them and populate the graph library accordingly.

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Liberty. We have some "read" pass in lgraph
* Create an object to hide the interface with a C++17 iterator
* Capacity to merge many files in the same object (inou_liberty)
* The read formats should be backed with mmap_lib (zero load time). Single per lgdb directory

* Wrapper to get timing for cells considering load

## FPGA Legalization

Legalize FPGA cell/LUT placement.

Dependence: FPGA Placer and RapidWright

Main features:

* Based on "A Fast, Robust Network Flow-based Standard-Cell Legalization Method for Minimizing Maximum Movement" but applied to FPGA
* Handle incremental. Only marked blocks need to be legalized. Already legalized blocks should not move (faster incremental that avoids re-routing blocks)
* Handle macros (SRAMs, DSPs, ....) that can have floating or fix location
* Handle packing and clock domains

## Floorplanner

Implement a floorplanner for large LGraph designs (firesim target).

Dependence: coloring

Main features:

* Planar graph. Cluster pipeline stages until the graph is planar.

* Implement a more traditional floorplanner leveraging min-cut.
* Do hierarchy. Hierarchy preserves symmetry. Bassed on "A hierarchical approach for generating regular ï¬‚oorplans"
* Different partitions are marked with different colors.

* Net Cluster: A Net-Reduction-Based Clustering Preprocessing Algorithm for Partitioning and Placement
* LSC: A large-scale consensus-based clustering algorithm for high-performance FPGAs
* Enumeration technique in very large-scale integration fixed-outline floorplanning
* A hierarchical approach for generating regular ï¬‚oorplans
* Network Flow Based Datapath Bit Slicing
* For planar/clustering ideas papers:
    * Visualizing fuzzy overlapping communities in networks
    * modularity and community structure in networks
    * The State of the Art in Visualizing Group Structures in Graphs


## Performance Monitoring Infrastructure

We perform regression for correctness, we should have regressions for
performance. This includes completion times and tracking CPU performance
counters. The setup uses prometheus/grafana
(https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/)

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Create scbench to gather stats and performance counters
* stat.begin, stat.end, stat.pause

## OpenSTA

 Evolve the opentimer to be more generic and have openTimer and openSTA as potential backends.

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Get timing from openSTA and get openTimer to work

## ECO pass with LGraph

Leverage the incremental and push it further to make LGraph the ECO flow for open source

Dependence: bring back incremental synthesis, coloring, and SAT solver

Main features:

* Incremental synthesis optimizes for speed, ECO optimizes for small size partition.

## Amazon F1

Clean productive flow for Amazon F1

Dependence: Rapidwright, incremental synthesis

Main features:

* Do a full flow of LGraph for F1. Fast incremental

## OpenDB

Integrate OpenDB flows with LGraph

Dependence: none

Main features:
* The new OpenDB from OpenRoad is a good backend (ASIC) bridge that we may want to build.
* Through OpenDB we can leverage full ASIC synthesis and tools like OpenSTA

## Pyrope to LNAST (Kenneth Mayer)

Create a elab parser for Pyrope and create LNAST nodes

Dependence: none

Main features:
* Implement Pyrope ELAB custom parser
* Error/warning friendly (clang class quality)
* Very fast parser
* Translate to LNAST

## SAT/SMT type checking for Pyrope

Use a SMT solver to constraint all the types. Use the SMT to find valid bits for each variable and check that it is "satisfiable"

Dependence: SAT Solver

Main features:

* when unsat, maybe use a MAXSAT to find the maxium SAT and report the other as the source of SAT problem.
* Bitwidth inference using SMT (min/max bits)
* Assertions "I"/"N", are placed to help constraints
* Provide a failing example
* Maybe a MAXSAT example? to report an error. For error reporting, the inputs/outputs per module and the LoC that violates the constraint may be an better way to debug.

## Pyrope/LNAST AI Warning

Create a AI based warning/error system for Pyrope and LNAST.

Dependence: Pyrope to LNAST

Main features:

* Break the code in "chunks" in parsed code (verilog, c-functions, pyrope).
* One error per chunk
* Build AST per chunk with incremental parsing (tree-sitter like)
* Create DB with error messages and "signatures"
* AI signatures are:
    * AST (pre and post-fix AST)
    * Find AST "diff" with other parts of code base. Feed diffs as signatures
    * Have DB with fuzz regex to point potentially similar variables
* Have a fuzz regex to find very similar messages to collapse at entry ("missing string" or "string not found")

## FPGA Placer

Build an analytical placer for FPGAs based on Ripple-FPGA.

Dependence: none

Main features:
* Use https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp/glop as solver
* Use with https://github.com/SebastianSchlag/kahypar for min-cut
* Being able to transfer placed design to Rapidwright
* Target Alveo U250

Main steps:

* Dump animations on placement with https://github.com/dtschump/CImg Just dump png every n-iterations (or seconds)
* Replace lpsolve with google glop (Bazel build) https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp/glop
* Replace patoh with kahypar (Bazel build) https://github.com/SebastianSchlag/kahypar
* Get it to build with Bazel as a separate repo (not in lgraph)
* Benchmark a potential replacement of Eigen library with SuperSCS (This is over 70% of the time for large bench. Try different libraries pick faster SuperSCS?)
    * gp_qsolve.cpp (location for Eigen)
    * SuperSCS code example in C: https://kul-forbes.github.io/scs/examples_in_c.html
    * In-place solver leveraging LGraph is also very reasonable as alternative

Some characteristics/thoughts to consider:

* Get inspirantion from "BonnPlace: A Self-Stabilizing Placement Framework" and RippleFPGA
* If floorplaner is there, leverage floorplan, but do not assume shape (square) in contour. Allow to place around each floorplan area (amorphous. A center of gravity per floorplan block)
* Use timing in feedback
* Cluster flops (buses)
* To allow fast incremental placement. Allow to do analytical over subset of design, and other areas are fixed (legalization to handle)
* Critical paths are aligned
* Use a rough global router to "spread" when needed.
* Use constraint solver for packing
* Support "annotations"
    * Relative place (left/right/top/bottom)
    * Alignment (true/false)
    * Close by (add anchor)
* benchmark against:
    * https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr-bench

## NextPNR

Integrate with the nextPNR FPGA placement/routing

Dependence: Rapidwright

Main features:
* Create a bridge to/from LGraph and nextpntr (json)

## simdjson

Migrate out of rapidjson to simdjson.

Dependence: none

Main requirements:

* Use https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/tree/master/singleheader instead of rapidjson
* Create a json dump compatible with yosys json dump to interface with netlistsvg, yosys, and nextpnr

## Cloud

Main requirements:

* Able to scale up/down automatically, and down to zero if not used
* Fast latencies
* Able to use google/AWS and local servers

Some potential implementation:

Need to have a way to generate a "patch/diff" from the lgdb. The idea is that
we send commands to the could with a lgdb, then we do a merge. If there are
conflicts (merge), we need to retrigger.  Similar to the "development" process
but with livehd (lgdb directory) runs. For the diff/patch command, I would start with
https://github.com/sisong/HDiffPatch

The hdiffpatch should be fine for everything but graph_library. This one may require a special program
to merge. E.g:

```
hdiffz -g#lgdb/graph_library.json  lgdb lgdb2 patch
hpatchz  lgdb patch lgdb3
```

After each command, the "delta" is sent back and applied to the front

* REST API for all the servers.
* Use httplib. See lgraph/main/userver_test.cpp and lgraph/main/uclient_test.cpp
* lgshell commands
    * cloud.server
    * cloud.ping     ; ping a server or front-end
    * cloud.frontend ; setup a front-end server to distributue the work to existing servers
    * cloud.link     ; setup lgshell as client. Next commands may go to server (in priority order)
* Server and client must have same git clone token (version) check for consistency.
* When in server mode, transfer client files, monitor server files, and transfer back. The trasfer uses the patch/diff. If patch files, it retriggers again.
* Add bazel the option of creating a alpine docker image directly to deploy lgraph in the cloud as an rest API service
* Create bringup and shutdown inside lgshell. Allow for local machines and gcloud/aws
    * cloud.start priority:1 local:true
    * cloud.start priority:2 ssh:mada1
    * cloud.start priority:33 cloud:xxx-parameters-for-gcloud
    * cloud.shutdown # kills any cloud.start that was spawned before
    * cloud.list   # list servers available at this lgdb setup (previous clould.start...)

# Active Projects (already selected)

## SAT Solver

Main requirements:

* Optimize equiv check. Traverse and remove subsets with same functionality
* Allow to SAT equiv graphs marked
* Reduce ports in rams, and collapse muxes when parallel/full case
* Partition graph in sub-graphs. Each subgraph can synthesis/check by itself.

Decide ezSAT or boolector or CVC or (ezSAT + XX)

* https://boolector.github.io/docs/cboolector.html
* Create a small benchmark and decide (some simple circuit)

extend ezSAT and interface with lgraph to:

* check equivalence of lgraphs
* Reduce port in SRAMs
* Check parallel cases in muxes

Potential paper:

* Use the net names from incremental synthesis to partition design (if partition verifies, we are done)
* Use structural traversal to remove search space (from inputs/outputs)
* Use parallel SAT checks (each output cone, partition of cones, after synth)
* Mark "boundaries" for equivalence in lgraph. Faster synthesis, verification...
* Different SAT solvers in parallel (ezsat, CVC4, SPT) and pick fastest

Maybe use https://github.com/Boolector/boolector


# Past Projects

## Mockturtle (Qian Chen)

Integrate EPFL mockturtle (https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle) with LGraph. The main characteristics:

* Use mockturtle to tmap to LUTs
* Use mockturtle to synthesize (optimize) logic
* Enable cut-rewrite as an option
* Enable hierarchy cross optimization
* Explore cross cuts optimization (flops/arith/...)
* Re-timing
* Map to LUTs only gates and non-wide arithmetic. E.g: 32bit add is not mapped to LUTS, but a 2-bit add is mapped.
* List of resources to not map:
    * Large ALUs. Large ALUs should have an OpenWare block (hardcoded in FPGAs and advanced adder options in ASIC)
    * Multipliers and dividers
    * Barrell shifters with not trivial shifts (1-2 bits) selectable at run-time
    * memories, luts

Some tasks that were not finished that a potential future project can address: (Good undergraduate projects)

* Split the graph coloring code out of pass/mockturtle to pass/coloring
* Extend the LUTs to have "bit-width". If a LUT operates over a "bus", it can have a multi-bit input per port".
* Avoid simple NOTs by having negated ports. E.g: 0-3 are possitive, ports 4-7 are negated inputs.
* Go over the [cleanup.md](cleanup.md) pending tasks.

## ABC (Yunxun Qiu)

Integrate ABC with LGraph. The interface use the C-API, bit the file dump format.

## FIRRTL 2 LNAST (Hunter Coffman)

There is an ongoing effort to bring from frontends to LNAST. This is a frontend/backend
project ot interface with high level FIRRTL.

Dependence: none

Main features:

* Bridge between high level FIRRTL and LGraph using LNAST (to/from FIRRTL translation)
* Ideally handle "high level FIRRTL" Then, we can read out of CHISEL.
* Benchmark is rocketchip and BOOM
* How to handle annotations? (unclear at the moment if we need this)


# Open Medium Size Tasks (not MS project/thesis)

This is a list of small tasks. Each should take 1-3 weeks to implement. These
are not thesis/projects but good ideas to get to know the setup and help, and they
can evolve for undergraduate senior design.

## mmap_lib sview delete

The mmap_lib used strings for mmap_map and mmap_bimap. The current version
appends the string to an mmap. It should have a counter to garbage collect the
mmap entry once nobody uses it. This means that it needs to track
create/delete. Maybe a mmap_map tracking sviews.

For the bimap, the sview is replicated for both directions. Again, the refactor
should share the sview across the two mmap_maps.

## mmap_lib set optimized for lgraph

Most lgraph have consecutive (or just 1-3 skip) node ids. Several algorithms
use sets. Currently, we use the absl::flat_hash_set. This has a high overhead
(store hash+xtra is around 8 bytes per entry) for when a simple bit enough if
the set is dense (consecutive nids).

We can not use dense arrays because we have the hierarchy which creates "gaps".
A potential "good enough" solution is to use the mmap_lib map but store 64
(8bytes) consecutive bit vector. This means that the index hash is (xx>>5) and
the lower bits (xx&0x1F) are used to select the bit in the map entry. This
amortizes the map entry costs over several "likely consecutive" entries in the
map.

## mmap_lib::vector erase (pop_back)

The current only way to shrink a mmap_lib::vector is with a resize command. It
should be good to allow a pop_back (erase last element). Notice that the mmap
call is expensive, we just need to really reduce size when there is a
significant fraction to be saved.

## Setup a vagrant image

We have several dockers for testing, a simple vagrant (ubuntu based?) for most users may
be nice to have. Maybe based on https://github.com/VLSIDA/openram-vagrant-image

## lgshell ctrl+C

* Intercept the CTRL+C and finish the current command. Do not kill/terminate the lgshell
* This may require to spawn the commands as threads and kill them for ctrl+c

## lgshell perf summary

* Record the time (and perf stats) for each lgshell command executed.
* Print the statistics when clossing the lgshell

## Query shell (not lgshell) to query graphs

* Based on replxx (like lgshell)
* Query bits, ports...  like
    * https://github.com/rubund/netlist-analyzer
    * https://www.jameswhanlon.com/querying-logical-paths-in-a-verilog-design.html
* It would be cool if subsections (selected) parts can be visualized with something like https://github.com/nturley/netlistsvg
* The shell may be expanded to support simulation in the future

## SIMD json

LiveHD uses rapidjson in several places. There is a newer SIMD json library that leverages SIMD instructions to perform a faster json parsing. An issue is that SIMD json does not have code generation.

The idea will be to benchmark the difference in speed, if the difference is less than 2x, it may not bet worth having 2 code bases.


## Benchmark API in lgshell

* Able to get time and performance statistics for tasks in lghsell
* perf.start, perf.stop, perf.dump commands to allow things like:

```
lgshell> perf.start
lgshell> lgraph.open name:foo |> ....
lgshell> perf.stop
```

## Use SLATE to document key API

Go over public methods in node, node pin, graph library, sub node, and create a
SLATE entry.

Point to some of the unit tests using the API, and create. Feel free to create
trivial examples that run with unit tests as sample of usage.

## Setup gupm for Pyrope and LiveHD

https://github.com/azukaar/GuPM

* Create pyrope repo for gupm
* Allow to have pyrope libraries (adder, multipler, corex....) as packages
* Allow to specify a specific lgraph library
* Allow to specify passes/commands in lgraph

## LGraph and LNAST check pass

Create a pass that checks that the LGraph (and/or LNAST) is sementically correct. Some checks:

* No combinational loops
* No missmatch in bit widths
* No disconnected nodes
* No nodes that could be DCE
* Check for innefficient splits (do not split busses that can be combined)
* Transformations stages should not drop names if same net is preserved

## Copy Propagation Pass

Create a copy propagation pass that works with hierarchy.

## Smaller tasks

For even smaller tasks check the [cleanup.md](cleanup.md) file


# Deprecated projects

This is a list of projects that were proposed, but that they are dropped. It includes a justification of why they got dropped.
This section of the document is to learn about the selection/deselection process.

## lhdview

DEPRECATION REASON: The lhdview was a "custom" application proposal. There is an external effort to bring wavedrom zoom and atom
integration. The idea is to have the same functionality as the proposed lhdview but to complement/help/leverage the atom flow.
The flow is fairly similar to liveOS, there is a web server collecting statistics and vcd traces. The client has the capacity to
zoom/view signals (web client). An atom client can coordinate with the viewer and become a vivado like. A console could be open to
interact with the remote server.


Live Hardware Development Viewer. The long term goal is to create an
verdi/simvision alternative with a Live focus. This is a large project that
should be split for 2 thesis (waveform and rest). The plan is to use nana++
(http://nanapro.org/en-us/) or QT. Prof Renau has a skeleton for the
application.

Some example screenshot:
 https://www.cadence.com/content/dam/cadence-www/global/en_US/images/old-tools/system-design-verification/debug_fig_sim_vision_windows.jpg

Dependence: This project can needs the binary format with mmap from Hot Reload

Main features:

 * Annotated source window: A window that shows text (verilog/pyrope) and the values for variables. Simvision calls this the "source browser window".
 * Waveform window. A gtkwave like capacity to show waveforms.
 * Signals search window
 * Reads mmap_lib structures so that it automatically gets updated as the simulation runs (live updates)

 ### Source Window

 * Shows current and previou[s] values for each variable
 * double click on the variable gets you to the driver.
 * Clicking on variable shows on the "search window" the driver (top) and consumers (bottom) from the variable
 * It uses source map (https://github.com/mgreter/sourcemap.cpp) to show the "original" code, not the "generated" verilog or "C".
 * Variables can be draged to/from the waveform window. (shift+click adds to waveform view, shift+double click adds driver to waveform)
 * There can be several source windows
 * Style: avoid dialogs, minimalist, multiple panels, tune for dark background, vi-like, fuzzy search, focus on read code (not edit, but allow edit)
 * Some edits to potentially leverage code/ideas:
     * Very fast load times: https://github.com/arximboldi/ewig
     * Clean value search (debug): https://gitlab.com/cppit/jucipp
     * neovim component (implement vim commands): https://github.com/rhysd/neovim-component
 * Option: juice integrated with neovim, variables underneath, add verilog/pyrope style, read value dump (mmap-VCD), go back/forth time...
 * Option: integrate/leverage scintilla (must integrate with GUI, and other waveform viewer) and neovim

### Waveform Window

 * GTKwave like with capacity to drag to/from source window
 * Query to LGraph to have "order" in variables computed. This is shown in the wave form like small delays (up to 40% of the cycle for delays? maybe configurable)
 * Capacity to add edges (like in wavedrom, https://observablehq.com/@drom/wavedrom) leveraging producer consumer info from lgraph
 * load/save configured signal configuration through the console window
 * Struct-like support for signals (groups)
 * markers

### Search Window

 * Fuzzy regex search for signals (fzf like https://github.com/hansonw/fuzzy-native/blob/master/src/score_match.cpp) but tuned for verilog/pyrope search
 * capacity to show hierarchy (alphabetically sorted) and restrict search per level (or sub-levels)
 * Only one search window

### Console window

 * hot reload console. Mostly allow drag variables from/to windows.
 * source/waveform/search windows can be controlled from console
 * allow to load/save list of commands
